<p style="font-family:Cursive; font-size:24px;color:#C4C4CF"> At Lorenzo de Zavala Middle School we take pride in the annual Science Bowl competition. Science Bowl is a competition based on the idea of "Jeopardy". Two teams compete Head-to-Head in a series of questions. These questions could come from any aspect of science, including space, chemistry, physics, biology, math, and more. At the begininning of a round, the first question is always a toss-up question. This means that the question is up for grabs by both teams and by any team member. If you even think that you know the answer, you can hit your buzzer and say your answer. Say your team got the question right. Next, would be the bonus question. Since bonus questions are worth a whopping ten points, they are super valuable and help win games! On the other hand, say your team got the question wrong. The question would be handed over to the other team, and they would get to have another shot at getting it coorect. Science Bowl is a major competition that goes all the way to national level.
